# Exploring Weather Trends 

### Summary
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends in a city near to where I live to overall global temperature trends.

The goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. To do this I’ll follow the steps below:

- Extract the data from the database: obtain the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where I live, writing SQL queries and exporting to CSV files.
- Open up the CSV files using Excel, Google sheets, Python or R.
- Create a line chart that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
