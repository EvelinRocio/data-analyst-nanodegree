### Investigate a dataset: Medical appointment no-shows

In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I'll make use of the Python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn, as well as Jupyter notebooks and Anaconda.

The dataset contains information on more than 110k medical appointments scheduled in Brazil in 2016.

The goal of the analysis is to explore which factors are associated with a patient attending a medical appointment. Some possible questions to support this analysis are:

- How does appointment attendance vary according to the patient's age and gender? Do women attend more than men? Do older people attend more than younger people?
- Do people with pre-existing illnesses (hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism) or with a disability tend to respect medical appointments more?
- Do people who receive help from the government tend to go to the doctor more than those who do not?
- Do people who receive an SMS reminder tend to miss less appointments?
