# Wrangle and Analyze data

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.  I will document this wrangling process in a Jupyter Notebook and showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and SQL.

The dataset that I will be wrangling, analyzing and visualizing is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. It has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
